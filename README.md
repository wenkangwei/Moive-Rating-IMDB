# Moive-Rating-IMDB
This project can be separated into two parts
1. It demonstrates the process of training a model to predict if a comment is positive or negative
2. An extension of part 1: to predict the intensity of the rating. That is, if there is a rating score range from 0 to 10. Higher the score is, more positive the comment is.
Then the extended model is to predict this rating score.
